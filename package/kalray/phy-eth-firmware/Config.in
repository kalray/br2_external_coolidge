	  This option allows to specify a URL pointing to a kvx phy eth
	  firmware source tarball. This URL can use any protocol recognized by
	  Buildroot, like http://, ftp://, file:// or scp://.

	  When pointing to a local tarball using file://, you may want
	  to use a make variable like $(TOPDIR) to reference the root of
	  the Buildroot tree.
